# Go where Human is Going

A project of Man Following Robot developed with an aim to create a medium to transfer food items from one place to another.The files are described below - 
* `.pde` file consist of Java code that detects human body and convert it into a linear skeleton. Also, it detects the x-axis and y-axis displacement to recognize the position of the body within a frame in order to send commands for the movement of the robot.
* `.ino` file consist of Arduino code to send commands to Motor Driver to drive the robot by recieving commands from the Kinect through Bluetooth.

You can open this code in `Processing` and run it. You also need to download the `Kinect4WinSdk` Library.

*Note: It is still in progress, will be trying to make a robot to do all the action that a human does and also the code for it.*
